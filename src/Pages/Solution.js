        <h2>Why Graphene is Essential</h2>
        <p>
          Graphene stands out for its exceptional strength, being about 100
          times stronger than steel by weight, making it ideal for applications
          requiring high durability. Its superior electrical conductivity is
          transforming electronics, enabling faster, more efficient devices.
          Additionally, its thermal conductivity is crucial for advanced cooling
          and heat dissipation systems. The material‚Äôs flexibility and near
          transparency open new possibilities in innovative design, including
          next-gen displays.
