        <hr></hr>
        <p>Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, making it the thinnest compound known to man at one atom thick.</p>

          <h2>The Wonder Material</h2>
          <p>First isolated in 2004 by researchers at the University of Manchester, graphene is essentially a single layer of graphite, which is the material found in pencil lead.</p>
          <p>Despite being the thinnest material known, it's also one of the strongestâ€”about 200 times stronger than steel. It's also an excellent conductor of heat and electricity, and is nearly transparent.</p>
          <p>These remarkable properties make graphene a material with enormous potential across various industries, from electronics to medicine, energy, and beyond.</p>
